# **Indian Traffic Analysis Dashboard**

Analyze and visualize traffic patterns in major Indian city areas using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a complete workflow of **data analysis and visualization** using a synthetic Indian traffic dataset. It helps identify traffic trends, peak hours, and congestion patterns across multiple city locations.

**Key Highlights:**

* Hourly and daily traffic trends
* Location-based traffic analysis
* Traffic heatmaps for congestion visualization
* Simple traffic prediction using historical data

## **Dataset**

The dataset is **synthetic** and simulates:

* **Duration:** 1 week
* **Frequency:** Hourly
* **Locations:** Connaught Place, Bandra, MG Road, Electronic City, Jayanagar
* **Columns:**

  * `Timestamp` – Date and hour
  * `Location` – City area
  * `Vehicle_Count` – Number of vehicles

## **Libraries Used**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## **How to Run**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
```

2. Open `traffic_analysis_india.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run each cell sequentially to see **data, visualizations, and predictions**.

## **Project Outputs**

* Line charts: hourly and daily traffic trends
* Bar charts: location-based traffic
* Heatmap: traffic intensity by hour and day
* Prediction chart: next day traffic trends

**Example Heatmap:**

## **Skills Gained**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Basic predictive modeling
